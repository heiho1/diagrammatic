# Quantum Grammar Documentation

## Overview

Quantum Grammar is a system for parsing and analyzing sentences based on the principles that:
1. Grammar is observer-dependent (similar to quantum mechanics)
2. Facts require a specific positional-lodial-fact (5,6,7) pattern to be established
3. Tense modifies whether something is factual (present) or fictional (past/future)
4. Modification relationships between word categories follow directional patterns

## Core Numeric Codes (0-9)

The fundamental categorization system uses numeric codes:

| Code | Category | Function |
|------|----------|----------|
| 0 | CONJUNCTION | Logical connectors: AND, OR |
| 1 | ADVERB | Modifies verbs and other words |
| 2 | VERB | Action, thinking, being |
| 3 | ADJECTIVE | Descriptive modifiers (coloring) |
| 4 | PRONOUN | Indefinite references without position |
| 5 | POSITION | Establishes spatial/relational context |
| 6 | LODIAL | Establishes ownership/possession |
| 7 | FACT | Noun with established space, time, energy |
| 8 | PAST-TIME-FICTION | Past-tense modifier (adds .8 to base code) |
| 9 | FUTURE-TIME-FICTION | Future-tense modifier (adds .9 to base code) |

## Word Lists

### POSITION Words (5)
BY, FOR, IN, OUT, OF, AS, WITH, OFF, ON, OUTSIDE, WITHIN, UP, DOWN, ROUND, THROUGH

### LODIAL Words (6)
Articles and determiners establish possession/ownership:
A, AN, ANY, EACH, EITHER, EVERY, THE, THIS, THESE, THOSE, THEIR, HIS, HER, MY, YOUR, OUR

### CONJUNCTION Words (0)
AND (&), OR (/)

## Core Principle: The 5,6,7 Pattern

**A FACT is established by the sequence: POSITION (5) > LODIAL (6) > FACT (7)**

```
For the healing = 5 6 7 (a positioned-lodial-fact, establishing healing as a fact)
of the quantum-body = 5 6 7 (another positioned-lodial-fact)
```

**Without the 5,6,7 pattern, no facts are established.** The sentence contains only fictional language (pronouns, adverbs, adjectives without positional grounding).

### Complete Example

**Sentence:** For the healing of the quantum-body is with the natural-light by the living-creation.

**Pattern:** 5 6 7 5 6 7 2 5 6 7 5 6 7

**Parsing:**
- For the healing = 5 6 7 (FACT: positioned healing)
- of the quantum-body = 5 6 7 (FACT: positioned quantum-body)
- is = 2 (VERB: linking the facts)
- with the natural-light = 5 6 7 (FACT: positioned natural-light)
- by the living-creation = 5 6 7 (FACT: positioned living-creation)

## Tense Modification

Tense modifies the numeric value using decimals:

- **Present tense** = Base code (factual, has space/time/energy)
- **Past tense** = Base code + .8 (past-time-fiction, ended = 1.8)
- **Future tense** = Base code + .9 (future-time-fiction, going = 1.9)

### Tense Examples
- healing (present) = 7 (FACT)
- healed (past) = 7.8 (PAST-TIME-FICTION-FACT)
- will heal (future) = 7.9 (FUTURE-TIME-FICTION-FACT)
- quickly (present adverb) = 1
- ended (past adverb) = 1.8 (PAST-TIME-FICTION-ADVERB)
- going (future adverb) = 1.9 (FUTURE-TIME-FICTION-ADVERB)

## Modification Directionality

Modification relationships use directional symbols:

- `>` = Modifies in forward direction
- `<` = Modified by (backward direction)
- `<>` = Bidirectional modification

### Common Modification Patterns

| Pattern | Meaning | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| 1>2 | ADVERB modifies VERB | quickly ran |
| 4<1>2 | PRONOUN modified by ADVERB; ADVERB modifies VERB | I quickly ran |
| 5>6>7 | POSITION modifies LODIAL; LODIAL modifies FACT | for the cat |
| 3>4 | ADJECTIVE modifies PRONOUN | quick one |
| 3<>4<1>3<>4 | ADJECTIVE and PRONOUN bidirectionally modify each other with ADVERB mediation | Complex modifications |

## Contextual Rules

Words function differently depending on their position and surrounding context:

### Rule 1: POSITION without LODIAL
**When a POSITION word is not followed by LODIAL, it functions as an ADVERB (1)**

Example: run through (through = 1, modifying the verb)

### Rule 2: LODIAL without POSITION
**When a LODIAL word is not preceded by a POSITION word, it functions as an ADVERB (1)**

Example: Starting sentence with the without a preposition

### Rule 3: FACT at Sentence Start
**When a FACT (noun) appears at the start of a sentence without the 5,6,7 pattern, it functions as a PRONOUN (4)**

Example: cat sat - cat = 4 (PRONOUN), not 7 (FACT) because no 5,6,7 pattern precedes it

## Sentence Structure Templates

### Positional-Lodial-Fact Phrase Template

**For establishing facts, sentences follow this structure:**

- ~1 FOR THE CAUSE: Witnessing-fact, Learning-fact, [DIS]Covery-fact, Closure-fact
- ~2 OF THE CONSEQUENCE: Storage of learning = structural knowledge [ONE OR MORE PHRASES]
- ~3 WITH 'IS/ARE': Verb-thinking as motion of knowledge [ONE PER SENTENCE]
- ~4 WITH THE POSSESSIVE: (HAVING OR LACKING) [ONE OR MORE PHRASES]
- ~5 BY AN AUTHORIZATION/AUTHOR/AUTHENTIC [GOLD=AU in periodic table]

### Multi-Directional Position Term Pairs

Position terms have forward/backward equivalents for bidirectional analysis:

BY/FOR, IN/IN, OUT/OUT, OF/WITH, OFF/OFF, ON/ON, OUTSIDE/OUTSIDE, WITHIN/WITHIN, UP/UP, DOWN/DOWN, ROUND/ROUND, THROUGH/THROUGH

## Additional Grammatical Concepts

### HEXEME (Prefix Morpheme)
A prefix modification morpheme (ADVERB, ADJECTIVE, TIME, POSITION, or OWNERSHIP) at the starting position of a word, modifying the base lexeme.

Example: un-happy (un = hexeme modifying happy)

### VEXEME (Suffix Morpheme)
A suffix modification morpheme (ADJECTIVE, ADVERB, TIME, POSITION, or OWNERSHIP) at the finishing position of a word.

Example: running (ing = vexeme modifying run)

### QUANTUM-MORPHEME
A morpheme without modification performance, appearing at starting, continuation, or finishing position of a lexeme.

## Punctuation Rules

- **Single quotes around letters/numbers/symbols**: Literal spelling-closure
- **'S' with single quote**: Fact-ownership-spelling ('s or s')
- **Square brackets []**: Different document plane (educational-learning, reader comprehension, author commentary)
- **Parentheses ()**: Multiple fact-claims as single compound-fact
- **= Symbol**: Equivalence (meaning, thinking, or value) between terms
- **Double quotes **: Citations, foreign language, fictional language, common phrases, titles
- **Forward slash /**: Multi-directional separation in position-term pairs

## Key Distinctions

### Fact vs. Fiction
- **FACT**: Has space, time, and energy; established by 5,6,7 pattern
- **FICTION**: Lacks space, time, or energy; adjectives, adverbs, pronouns without positional grounding

### Present vs. Past/Future
- **Present (base code)**: Factual, occurring now with space/time/energy
- **Past (.8 modifier)**: Fictional-time, historical reference
- **Future (.9 modifier)**: Fictional-time, projected reference

## Implementation Notes

When building a quantum grammar parser:

1. **First, identify 5,6,7 patterns** - these establish facts
2. **Apply contextual rules** - determine if words function as primary or secondary categories
3. **Use modification patterns** - track directional relationships between word categories
4. **Apply tense modifiers** - adjust codes based on temporal references
5. **Analyze modification chains** - show how words relate to and modify each other

## Example Parsing Walkthrough

**Sentence:** The cat quickly ran into the house yesterday.

**Initial word-by-word tagging:**
- The = 6 (LODIAL)
- cat = 7 (FACT) - but checking context...
- quickly = 1 (ADVERB)
- ran = 2 (VERB)
- into = 5 (POSITION)
- the = 6 (LODIAL)
- house = 7 (FACT)
- yesterday = 1.8 (ADVERB with PAST-TIME-FICTION)

**Applying contextual rules:**
- The cat - no 5 before 6, so needs positional context
- If sentence starts without 5, then the cat is not a positioned-fact
- This sentence lacks a 5,6,7 pattern, so it's describing a fictional/indefinite situation

**Modification pattern:**
- 4 < 1 > 2 > 5 > 6 > 7 (PRONOUN modified by ADVERB; ADVERB modifies VERB; VERB leads to positioned-fact)
